            1. Dogs noses are wet to help absorb scent chemicals
            This amazing dog fact might answer a long-standing question that dog owners have. Why are dogs’ noses wet? Vetstreet says that the answer is that dog’s noses are wet to help them absorb scent chemicals! Their nose secretes a special mucus that helps to absorb these chemicals, and then they lick their noses to sample them, helping them understand what the smell is.

            2. Newfoundlands are amazing lifeguards
            Newfoundland dogs are the ultimate doggy lifeguards, because they have water resistant coats and webbed feet. They were originally bred as fisherman’s helpers and to rescue people from drowning. 
            Although it may be anthropomorphism or interpretation on the part of the owners, some say their dogs try to “rescue” them when they swim.

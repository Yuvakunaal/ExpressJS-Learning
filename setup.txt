Step-1 :- Install node : https://youtu.be/DFfDYjVlRZw?si=iCBnNRWd6HNbIf3e

Step-2 :- Create a new empty folder and open it with vscode.

Step-3 :- Open terminal in vscode

Step-4 :- run the command 'node -v' (to check the version of node.if it shows any error,it means node is not installed)

Step-5 :- run the command 'npm init -y'

Step-6 :- run the command 'npm install express'

....After successfully completing all these, You are done with setup of express

Step-7 :- Create a file 'index.js'
Step-8 :- To run :-
---------------------------------------------------------------
import express from 'express';
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get("/",(req,res) => {
    res.send("Hello world !");
});

app.listen(port,() => {
    console.log(`Server Running on port ${port}...`);
});
---------------------------------------------------------------
write the above code in 'index.js' other js code....this js code is used to run the server in 3000 port
-> After typing this in index.js
-> run this command in vscode terminal :-
mac users = ' sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN '
window users = ' netstat -ano | findstr "LISTENING" '
(it asked for password, then type your system lockscreen password)

-> after running this, run this command 'node index.js'
-> http://localhost:3000/ -> copy and paste in google search... you will see the website...

#### Better way of running
-> run this command to work with node globally means rather than stopping and re-running repeatedly we can install and use this everytime we work out with express or node -> 'npm i -g nodemon'
-> now run this command :- 'npx nodemon index.js'
-> by doing this, it automatically saves the changes and updates in website (without restarting the server)
-> refresh webpage in google...

### There for the complete setup and running in local server is done.....

Note : to exit terminal running :- press -> ctrl + c
